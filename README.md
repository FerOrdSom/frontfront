# Front-front

Learning proyect on the fundations of game development.

## Objectives:

- Build a simulation of a forever rebounding ball.
- Exercise on reusable code. The solution sould be a good starting point for more complex games.
- Exercise on breaking down new problems.
- Exercise on development cycle.
- Document the learning process, decisions, and sources.

## The problem:
In order to achieve this basic game, some requirements are needed:

[Runner](https://github.com/FerOrdSom/frontfront/tree/main/doc/runner.md): Initializes and controls the *game loop*, wich is the main part of any game. In this case, the loop is going to do two things:
- Simulate: Calculates next state of the game. Includes movement and collisions of objects.
- Render: Gives the ability to draw things on a screen.
